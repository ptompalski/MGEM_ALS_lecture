  abstract = {Tropical forest canopies are comprised of tree crowns of multiple species varying in shape and height, and ground inventories do not usually reliably describe their structure. Airborne laser scanning data can be used to characterize these individual crowns, but analytical tools developed for boreal or temperate forests may require to be adjusted before they can be applied to tropical environments. Therefore, we compared results from six different segmentation methods applied to six plots (39 ha) from a study site in French Guiana. We measured the overlap of automatically segmented crowns projection with selected crowns manually delineated on high-resolution photography. We also evaluated the goodness of fit following automatic matching with field inventory data using a model linking tree diameter to tree crown width. The different methods tested in this benchmark segmented highly different numbers of crowns having different characteristics. Segmentation methods based on the point cloud (AMS3D and Graph-Cut) globally outperformed methods based on the Canopy Height Models, especially for small crowns; the AMS3D method outperformed the other methods tested for the overlap analysis, and AMS3D and Graph-Cut performed the best for the automatic matching validation. Nevertheless, other methods based on the Canopy Height Model performed better for very large emergent crowns. The dense foliage of tropical moist forests prevents sufficient point densities in the understory to segment subcanopy trees accurately, regardless of the segmentation method.},

  abstract = {Individual tree segmentation from airborne laser scanning data is a longstanding and important challenge in forest remote sensing. Tree segmentation algorithms are widely available, but robust intercomparison studies are rare due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable reference data. Here we provide a benchmark data set for temperate and tropical broadleaf forests generated from labelled terrestrial laser scanning data. We compared the performance of four widely used tree segmentation algorithms against this benchmark data set. All algorithms performed reasonably well on the canopy trees. The point cloud-based algorithm AMS3D (Adaptive Mean Shift 3D) had the highest overall accuracy, closely followed by the 2D raster based region growing algorithm Dalponte2016~+. However, all algorithms failed to accurately segment the understory trees. This result was consistent across both forest types. This study emphasises the need to assess tree segmentation algorithms directly using benchmark data, rather than comparing with forest indices such as biomass or the number and size distribution of trees. We provide the first openly available benchmark data set for tropical forests and we hope future studies will extend this work to other regions.},

The evaluation of the detection results was carried out in a reproducible way by automatically matching them to precise in situ forest inventory data using a restricted nearest neighbor detection approach. Quantitative statistical parameters such as percentages of correctly matched trees and omission and commission errors are presented. The proposed automated matching procedure presented herein shows an overall accuracy of 97\%. Method based analysis, investigations per forest type, and an overall benchmark performance are presented. The best matching rate was obtained for single-layered coniferous forests. Dominated trees were challenging for all methods. The overall performance shows a matching rate of 47\%, which is comparable to results of other benchmarks performed in the past. The study provides new insight regarding the potential and limits of tree detection with ALS and underlines some key aspects regarding the choice of method when performing single tree detection for the various forest types encountered in alpine regions.},

This work concentrates on delineating individual trees in topographically-complex, mixed conifer forest across the California's Sierra Nevada. We delineated individual trees using vector data and a 3D lidar point cloud segmentation algorithm, and using raster data with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of a canopy height model (CHM). The two approaches are compared to each other and to ground reference data. We used high density (9 pulses/m2), discreet lidar data and WorldView-2 imagery to delineate individual trees, and to classify them by species or species types. We also identified a new method to correct artifacts in a high-resolution CHM. Our main focus was to determine the difference between the two types of approaches and to identify the one that produces more realistic results. We compared the delineations via tree detection, tree heights, and the shape of the generated polygons. The tree height agreement was high between the two approaches and the ground data (r2: 0.93--0.96). Tree detection rates increased for more dominant trees (8--100 percent). The two approaches delineated tree boundaries that differed in shape: the lidar-approach produced fewer, more complex, and larger polygons that more closely resembled real forest structure.},

The three-dimensional multiview estimation chain with height measurements of individual trees proved less prone to random and systematic errors than the monoscopic chain. An upper limit of accuracy at the single-tree level is determined mainly by the allometric correlations. Volume estimates of single trees showed estimation accuracies (root-mean-square error, RMSE) of 15--20\% and 35--40\% in the multiview and monoscopic chains, respectively. This is lower than the accuracy achievable in the field, which is 6\%. Image-based single-tree forest inventory is prone to systematic measurement and model errors, and in a simulation for the total effect of error sources, upper estimation accuracies (RMSE) of 15\% and 30\% for stand volume were computed using full mapping of the stand with the multiview and monoscopic estimation chains, respectively.},

We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86 percent of the trees ("recall"), 94 percent of the segmented trees were correct ("precision"), and the overall F-score is 0.9.

While dense laser scanning offers detailed 3D representations, automating the segmentation of trees and their structures from point clouds remains difficult. The lack of suitable benchmark datasets and reliance on small datasets have limited method development. The emergence of deep learning models exacerbates the need for standardized benchmarks. Addressing these gaps, the FOR-instance data represent a novel benchmarking dataset to enhance forest measurement using dense airborne laser scanning data, aiding researchers in advancing segmentation methods for forested 3D scenes. In this repository, users will find forest laser scanning point clouds from unamnned aerial vehicle (using Riegl sensors) that are manually segmented according to the individual trees (1130 trees) and semantic classes. The point clouds are subdivided into five data collections representing different forests in Norway, the Czech Republic, Austria, New Zealand, and Australia. These data are meant to be used either for developement of new methods (using the dev data) or for testing of exisitng methods (test data).

Classification of the forest into jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), mixed conifer, mixedwood, and hardwood species groups resulted in an overall accuracy of 67.8\% compared with field data. A more generalized classification into softwood, hardwood, and mixedwood had an overall accuracy of 83.2\%. The reflectance in the red edge region of the electromagnetic spectrum ({$\lambda$} = 740 nm), the area and volume of tree crowns, and the cumulative distribution of LiDAR returns in the canopy were particularly important variables to discriminate between species groups.

The aim in this study was to predict individual tree height (Ht; m), basal area (BA; m2) and stem volume (V; m3) attributes using Random Forest k- nearest neighbor (RF k-NN) imputation and individual tree-level based metrics extracted from a LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forest in southwestern Georgia, USA. We developed a new framework for modeling tree-level forest attributes that was comprised of three steps: (1) individual tree detection, crown delineation and tree-level based metrics computation from LiDAR-derived CHM; (2) automatic matching of LiDAR-derived trees and field-based trees for a regression modeling step using a novel algorithm; and (3) RF k- NN imputation modeling for estimating tree-level Ht, BA, and V, and subsequent summarization of these metrics at the plot- and stand-levels. RMSDs for tree-level Ht, BA and V were 2.96\%, 58.62\% and 8.19\%, respectively. Although BA estimation accuracy was poor because of the longleaf pine growth habit, individual tree locations, Ht, and V were estimated with high accuracy, especially in low canopy cover conditions. Future efforts based on the findings could help to improve the estimation accuracy of individual tree-level attributes like BA.},

Despite the growing number of methods, relatively few have been comparatively assessed using a single benchmark forest inventory validation dataset, limiting their operational application. In this study, we assessed seven ITD methods, representing three common approaches (point-cloud-based, raster-based, hybrid), across coniferous forest stands with diverse structure and composition to understand how ITD and height measurement accuracy vary with method, input parameters and data, and stand density. There was little variability in accuracy between the ITD methods where the average F-score and standard deviation ({\textpm}SD) were 0.47 {\textpm} 0.03 using a lower pulse density ALS dataset with an average of 8 pulses per square meter (ppm2) and 0.50 {\textpm} 0.02 using a higher pulse density ALS dataset with an average of 22 ppm2. Using higher ALS pulse density data produced higher ITD accuracies (F-score increase of 10--13\%) in some of the methods versus more modest gains in other methods (F-score increase of 1--3\%). Omission errors were strongly related with stand density and largely consisted of suppressed trees underneath the dominant canopy. Simple canopy height model (CHM)-based methods that utilized fixed-size local maximum filters had the lowest omission errors for trees across all canopy positions. ITD accuracy had large intra-method variation depending on input parameters; however, the highest accuracies were obtained when parameters such as search window size and spacing thresholds were equal to or less than the average crown diameter of trees in the study area. All ITD methods produced height measurements for the detected trees that had low RMSE ({$<$}1.1 m) and bias ({$<$}0.5 m). Overall, the results from this study may help guide end-users with ITD method application and highlight future ITD method improvements.},

  abstract = {Traditional field-based forest inventories tend to be expensive, time-consuming, and cover only a limited area of a forested region. Remote sensing (RS), especially airborne laser scanning (ALS) has opened new possibilities for operational forest inventories, particularly at the single-tree level, and in the prediction of single-tree characteristics. Throughout the world, forests have varying characteristics that necessitate the development of modern, effective, and versatile tools for ALS data processing. To address this need, we aimed to develop a tool for individual tree detection (ITD) utilising a self-calibrating algorithm procedure and to verify its accuracy using the complicated forest structure of near natural forests in the temperate zone. This study was carried out in the Polish part of the Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Forest (BF). The airborne laser scanner (ALS) and color-infrared (CIR) datasets were acquired for more than 60 000 ha. Field-based measurements were performed to provide reference data at the single tree level. We introduced a novel ITD method that is self-calibrated and uses a hierarchical analyses of the canopy height model. There were more than 20 000 000 of trees in first layer in BF above 7 m height. Trees visible from above were divided into coniferous, deciduous and mixed trees that were then matched with an accuracy of 85 \%, 85 \% and 75 \%, respectively. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method is more flexible and achieves better results, especially for deciduous species. Before application of the presented method to other regions, the calibration based on the developed optimisation procedure is needed.},

This concept overcomes the limitations experienced by existing ITC segmentation methods that use aerial photographs to obtain texture and crown appearance information and commonly encounter interference due to heterogeneous solar illumination intensities or interlacing branches and leaves. Three generative adversarial networks (WGAN, CycleGAN, and SinGAN) were employed to generate synthetic images. These images were coupled with manually labeled training samples to train the network. Three forest plots, namely, a tree nursery, forest landscape and mixed tree plantation, were used to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results showed that the overall recall of our method for detecting ITCs in the three forest plot types reached 83.6\%, with an overall precision of 81.4\%. Compared with reference field measurement data, the coefficient of determination R2 was {$\geq$} 79.93\% for tree crown width estimation, and the accuracy of our deep learning method was not influenced by the values of key parameters, yielding 3.9\% greater accuracy than the traditional watershed method. The results demonstrate an enhancement of tree crown segmentation in the form of a heightmap for different forest plot types using the concept of deep learning, and our method bypasses the visual complications arising from aerial images featuring diverse textures and unordered scanned points with irregular geometrical properties.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on advancing individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation in lidar data, developing a sensor- and platform-agnostic deep learning model transferable across a spectrum of dense laser scanning datasets from drone (ULS), to terrestrial (TLS), and mobile (MLS) laser scanning data. In a field where transferability across different data characteristics has been a longstanding challenge, this research marks a step towards versatile, efficient, and comprehensive 3D forest scene analysis. Central to this study is model performance evaluation based on platform type (ULS vs. MLS) and data density. This involved five distinct scenarios, each integrating different combinations of input training data, including ULS, MLS, and their augmented versions through random subsampling, to assess the model's transferability to varying resolutions and efficacy across different canopy layers. The core of the model, inspired by the PointGroup architecture, is a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with dedicated prediction heads for semantic and instance segmentation. The model underwent comprehensive validation on publicly available, machine learning-ready point cloud datasets. Additional analyses assessed model adaptability to different resolutions and performance across canopy layers. Our results reveal that point cloud random subsampling is an effective augmentation strategy and improves model performance and transferability. The model trained using the most aggressive augmentation, including point clouds as sparse as 10 points m-2, showed best performance and was found to be transferable to sparse lidar data and boosts detection and segmentation of codominant and dominated trees. Notably, the model showed consistent performance for point clouds with densities {$>$}50 points m-2 but exhibited a drop in performance at the sparsest level (10 points m-2), mainly due to increased omission rates. Benchmarking against current state-of-the-art methods revealed boosts of up to 20\% in the detection rates, indicating the model's superior performance on multiple open benchmark datasets. Further, our experiments also set new performance baselines for the other public datasets. The comparison highlights the model's superior segmentation skill, mainly due to better detection and segmentation of understory trees below the canopy, with reduced computational demands compared to other recent methods. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that it is indeed feasible to train a sensor-agnostic model that can handle diverse laser scanning data, going beyond current sensor-specific methodologies. Further, our study sets a new baseline for tree segmentation, especially in complex forest structures. By advancing the state-of-the-art in forest lidar analysis, our work also lays the foundation for future innovations in ecological modeling and forest management.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurements of the structural characteristics of trees such as height, diameter, sweep and taper are an important part of forest inventories in managed forests and commercial plantations. Both terrestrial and aerial LiDAR are currently employed to produce pointcloud data from which inventory metrics can be determined. Terrestrial/ground-based scanning typically provides pointclouds resolutions of many thousands of points per m     2     from which tree stems can be observed and inventory measurements made directly, whereas typical resolutions from aerial scanning (tens of points per m     2    ) require inventory metrics to be regressed from LiDAR variables using inventory reference data collected from the ground. Recent developments in miniaturised LiDAR sensors are enabling aerial capture of pointclouds from low-flying aircraft at high-resolutions (hundreds of points per m     2    ) from which tree stem information starts to become directly visible, enabling the possibility for plot-scale inventories that do not require access to the ground. In this paper, we develop new approaches to automated tree detection, segmentation and stem reconstruction using algorithms based on deep supervised machine learning which are designed for use with aerially acquired high-resolution LiDAR pointclouds. Our approach is able to isolate individual trees, determine tree stem points and further build a segmented model of the main tree stem that encompasses tree height, diameter, taper, and sweep. Through the use of deep learning models, our approach is able to adapt to variations in pointcloud densities and partial occlusions that are particularly prevalent when data is captured from the air. We present results of our algorithms using high-resolution LiDAR pointclouds captured from a helicopter over two Radiata pine forests in NSW, Australia.},

Recently, a 3D segmentation approach was developed for extracting single trees from LiDAR data. However, key parameters for modules used in the strategy had to be empirically determined. This paper highlights a comprehensive study for the sensitivity analysis of 3D single tree detection from airborne LiDAR data. By varying key parameters, their influences on results are to be quantified. The aim of the study is to enlighten the optimal combination of parameter values towards new applications. For the experiment, a number of sample plots from two temperate forest sites in Europe were selected. LiDAR data with a point density of 25 pts/m2 over the first site in the Bavarian forest national park were captured with under both leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. Moreover, a Riegl scanner was used to acquire data over the Austrian Alps forest with four-fold point densities of 5 pts/m2, 10 pts/m2, 15 pts/m2 and 20 pts/m2, respectively, under leaf-off conditions. The study results proved the robustness and efficiency of the 3D segmentation approach. Point densities larger than 10 pts/m2 did not seem to significantly contribute to the improvement in the performance of 3D tree detection. The performance of the approach can be further examined and improved by optimizing the parameter settings with respect to different data properties and forest structures.},

  abstract = {This study presents a hybrid framework for single tree detection from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data by integrating low-level image processing techniques into a high-level probabilistic framework. The proposed approach modeled tree crowns in a forest plot as a configuration of circular objects. We took advantage of low-level image processing techniques to generate candidate configurations from the canopy height model (CHM): the treetop positions were sampled within the over-extracted local maxima via local maxima filtering, and the crown sizes were derived from marker-controlled watershed segmentation using corresponding treetops as markers. The configuration containing the best possible set of detected tree objects was estimated by a global optimization solver. To achieve this, we introduced a Gibbs energy, which contains a data term that judges the fitness of the objects with respect to the data, and a prior term that prevents severe overlapping between tree crowns on the configuration space. The energy was then embedded into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics coupled with a simulated annealing to find its global minimum. In this research, we also proposed a Monte Carlo-based sampling method for parameter estimation. We tested the method on a temperate mature coniferous forest in Ontario, Canada and also on simulated coniferous forest plots with different degrees of crown overlap. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of our proposed method, which was capable of reducing the commission errors produced by local maxima filtering, thus increasing the overall detection accuracy by approximately 10\% on all of the datasets.},

The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and the size of each plot was 200 m2. On the average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality.

A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding characteristics of entire forest stands was tested. Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m2 regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics were predicted for each grid cell from the corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated regression equations. Average values for each stand was computed. Most stand level predictions were unbiased (P{$>$}.05).

  abstract = {Individual tree based forest surveys are feasible using modern computer technology. The presented approach for analysing high spatial resolution (pixel size 10 cm) aerial images of naturally regenerated boreal forests is based on visible significant trees. Sunlight patches on the ground are suppressed, followed by optimal image smoothing. The problem with inclined illumination is handled by adapted thresholding. Each connected threshold segment (a collection of one or more trees) is further smoothed. A selection of the resulting convex edge segments is used for identifying significant tree crown circles. Six complementary image variables are estimated and used for regression analysis. An evaluation of the ground-truth data in central Sweden gives good results on the stem position estimate (a root mean square (RMS) error of 108 cm) and the stem number estimate (a relative RMS error of 11\%). The complementary variables contribute significantly to the stem diameter prediction, resulting in the following experimental values: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (R               2               = 59.5\%, s = 4.9 cm, N = 157), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.)

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of airborne lidar technology to measure forest biophysical characteristics has been rapidly increasing. This paper discusses processing algorithms for deriving the terrain model and estimating tree heights by using a multiple return, high--density, small-footprint lidar data set. The lidar data were acquired over deciduous, coniferous, and mixed stands of varying age classes and settings typical of the southeastern US. The specific objectives were: (1) to develop and test algorithms to estimate plot level tree height using lidar data, and (2) to investigate how ground measurements can help in the processing phase of lidar data for tree height assessment. The study area is located in the Piedmont physiographic province of Virginia, USA and includes a portion of the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest (37{$^\circ$}25{$\prime$}N, 78{$^\circ$}41{$\prime$}W). Two lidar processing algorithms are discussed---the first based on single tree crown identification using a variable window size for local filtering, and the second based on the height of all laser pulses within the area covered by the ground truth data. Height estimates resulted from processing lidar data with both algorithms were compared to field measurements obtained with a plot design following the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data layout. Linear regression was used to develop equations relating lidar-estimated parameters with field inventories for each of the FIA plots. As expected, the maximum height on each plot was predicted with the highest accuracy (R2 values of 85 and 90\%, for the first and the second algorithm, respectively). The variable window size algorithm performed better for predicting heights of dominant and co-dominant trees (R2 values 84--85\%), with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 12.7 cm (5 in), when compared with the algorithm based on all laser heights (R2 values 57--73\%). The use of field-based height thresholds when processing lidar data did not bring significant gains in explaining the total variation associated with tree height. The technique of local filtering with a variable window size considers fundamental forest biometrics relationships and overall proved to give better results than the technique of all laser shots.},

The tree delineation accuracy was evaluated by a five-fold, cross-validation method. Results showed that the absolute accuracy of tree isolation was 64.1 percent, which was much higher than the accuracy of the method, which only searched local maxima within window sizes determined by the regression curve (37.0 percent).},

  abstract = {While forest inventories based on airborne laser scanning data (ALS) using the area based approach (ABA) have reached operational status, methods using the individual tree crown approach (ITC) have basically remained a research issue. One of the main obstacles for operational applications of ITC is biased results often experienced due to segmentation errors. In this article, we propose a new method, called ``semi-ITC'' that overcomes the main problems related to ITC by imputing ground truth data within crown segments from the nearest neighboring segment. This may be none, one, or several trees. The distances between segments were derived based on a set of explanatory variables using two nonparametric methods, i.e., most similar neighbor inference (MSN) and random forest (RF). RF favored the imputation of common observations in the data set which resulted in significant biases. Main conclusions are therefore based on MSN. The explanatory variables were calculated by means of small footprint ALS and multispectral data. When testing with empirical data the new method compared favorably to the well-known ABA. Another advantage of the new method over the ABA is that it allowed for the modeling of rare tree species. The results of predicting timber volume with the semi-ITC method were unbiased and the root mean squared error (RMSE) on plot level was smaller than the standard deviation of the observed response variables. The relative RMSEs after cross validation using semi-ITC for total volume and volume of the individual species pine, spruce, birch, and aspen on plot level were 17, 38, 40, 101, and 222\%, respectively. Due to the unbiasedness of the estimation, this study is a showcase for how to use crown segments resulting from ITC algorithms in a forest inventory context.},

Classification of the forest into jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), mixed conifer, mixedwood, and hardwood species groups resulted in an overall accuracy of 67.8\% compared with field data. A more generalized classification into softwood, hardwood, and mixedwood had an overall accuracy of 83.2\%. The reflectance in the red edge region of the electromagnetic spectrum ({$\lambda$} = 740 nm), the area and volume of tree crowns, and the cumulative distribution of LiDAR returns in the canopy were particularly important variables to discriminate between species groups.

  abstract = {Characterization of tropical forest trees has been limited to field-based techniques focused on measurement of diameter of the cylindrical part of the bole, with large uncertainty in measuring large trees with irregular shapes, and other size attributes such as total tree height and the crown size. Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1ha, 2.25ha, 4ha, and 6.25ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from 16.9\% at 1ha for the worst model to 5.0\% at 6.25ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales ({\textasciitilde}4ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.},

  abstract = {LiDAR individual tree detection (ITD) is a promising tool for measuring forests at a scale that is meaningful ecologically and useful for forest managers. However, most ITD research evaluates methods over small homogeneous areas, while many forest managers work over large, complex landscapes. We investigated how ITD results varied across diverse structural conditions in California's Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests and what this taught us about when and how to apply ITD. Our results suggest that it is advantageous to use ITD when it improves analysis interpretability, when measuring horizontal patterns, or when field data are unavailable. In the latter case, it is best to focus on measures dominated by large trees, like basal area and biomass. Thinking of ITD results as ``tree-approximate objects'' including one dominant tree and up to a few subordinate tree respects LiDAR's strengths and limitations; we illustrate how this concept keeps analyses consistent across varying structural conditions.},

A new method was proposed in this study to improve the estimation of stem volume and timber assortments, by means of combining the Area-based approach (ABA) and individual tree detection (ITD), the two main approaches to deriving forest attributes from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Two methods, replacement, and histogram matching were employed to calibrate ABA-derived diameter distributions with ITD-derived diameter estimates at plot level. The results showed that more accurate estimates were obtained when calibrations were applied. In view of the highest accuracy between ABA and ITD, calibrated diameter distributions decreased its relative RMSE of the estimated entire growing stock, saw log and pulpwood fractions by 2.81\%, 3.05\% and 7.73\% points at best, respectively. Calibration improved pulpwood fraction significantly, which contributed to the negligible bias of the estimated entire growing stock. {\copyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: The increasing availability of three-dimensional point clouds, including both airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry, allow for the derivation of forest inventory information with a high level of attribute accuracy and spatial detail. When available at two points in time, point cloud datasets offer a rich source of information for detailed analysis of change in forest structure. Recent Findings: Existing research across a broad range of forest types has demonstrated that those analyses can be performed using different approaches, levels of detail, or source data. By reviewing the relevant findings, we highlight the potential that bi- and multi-temporal point clouds have for enhanced analysis of forest growth. We divide the existing approaches into two broad categories--- -- approaches that focus on estimating change based on predictions of two or more forest inventory attributes over time, and approaches for forecasting forest inventory attributes. We describe how point clouds acquired at two or more points in time can be used for both categories of analysis by comparing input airborne datasets, before discussing the methods that were used, and resulting accuracies. Summary: To conclude, we outline outstanding research gaps that require further investigation, including the need for an improved understanding of which three-dimensional datasets can be applied using certain methods. We also discuss the likely implications of these datasets on the expected outcomes, improvements in tree-to-tree matching and analysis, integration with growth simulators, and ultimately, the development of growth models driven entirely with point cloud data.},

  abstract = {The identification of individual tree species is crucial for forest inventory, carbon stocks assessment as well as for habitat and ecosystem change studies. Previous studies have shown the potential of using both the geometrical information (proportions, shape of the crown profile, etc.) and return intensities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds to identify trees. So far, single wavelength (1064 nm or 1550 nm) ALS systems have been the most common. Teledyne Optech Inc. (Vaughan, Canada) introduced the Titan multispectral airborne lidar, the first three-wavelength system, equipped with 1550 nm, 1064 nm and 532 nm lasers. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of this discrete return multispectral lidar (MSL) for identifying the species of single trees, compared to standard discrete single wavelength lidar. Two distinct datasets were acquired in the Toronto region, Canada. The point clouds of single trees were extracted and 3D and intensity classification features were computed. New intensity features were developed for this purpose, such as lidar NDVIs (normalized difference vegetation index). The species of each tree were identified with a random forest classifier using features calculated from 1) each channel separately and 2) all channels. A stringent selection strategy was employed to reduce the number of features down to 5--9, from 99--142. Trees were classified either as broadleaved (BL) or needleleaf (NL), by genus (4--7 classes), or by species (10 classes). When using all channels, the classification accuracy surpassed what was achieved with single channels, but this advantage was only significant when the number of classes was high, i.e. in the case of seven genera, or ten species. Using MSL data, the out-of-bag error was 3--5\% for the BL-NL classification, 13\% and 20\% for respectively four and seven genera, and 24\% for ten species. In the latter case, the best single-channel classification (based on 1550 nm data) resulted in an error of 35\%. In the MSL classification, the most useful features were the NDVIs (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, based on the intensity of infrared and green channels) and the 1550 nm intensities. We therefore conclude that species identification accuracy can be improved by using a three-wavelength ALS such as the Titan system compared to single channel ALS systems, especially when tree species diversity is fairly large (seven classes or more).},

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), as an active remote sensing technology, allows for the acquisition of three-dimensional point clouds of scanned areas, as well as a range of features allowing for increased performance of object extraction and classification approaches. As many publications have shown, multiple LiDAR-derived metrics, with the assistance of classification algorithms, contribute to the high accuracy of tree species discrimination based on data obtained by laser scanning. The aim of this article is to review studies in the species classification literature which used data collected by Airborne Laser Scanning. We analyzed these studies to figure out the most efficient group of LiDAR-derived features in species discrimination. We also identified the most powerful classification algorithm, which maximizes the advantages of the derived metrics to increase species discrimination performance. We conclude that features extracted from full-waveform data lead to the highest overall accuracy. Radiometric features with height information are also promising, generating high species classification accuracies. Using random forest and support vector machine as classifiers gave the best species discrimination results in the reviewed publications.},

  abstract = {Individual tree species classification is of strategic importance for forest monitoring, analysis, and management, which are critical for sustainable forestry development. In this regard, the paper proposes a method based on the profile of segmented individual tree laser scanning points to identify tree species. The proposed methodology mainly takes advantage of three-dimensional geometric features of a tree crown captured by a laser point cloud to identify tree species. Firstly, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) are used for Crown Height Model (CHM) generation. Then, local maximum algorithms and improved rotating profile-based delineations are used to segment individual trees from the profile CHM point data. In the next step, parallel-line shape fitting is used to fit the tree crown shape. In particular, three basic geometric shapes, namely, triangle, rectangle, and arc are used to fit the tree crown shapes of different tree species. If the crown belongs to the same crown shape or shape combination, parameter classification is used, such as the ratio of crown width and crown height or the apex angle range of the triangles. The proposed method was tested by two real datasets which were acquired from two different sites located at Tiger and Leopard National Park in Northeast China. The experimental results indicate that the average tree classification accuracy is 90.9\% and the optimal classification accuracy reached 95.9\%, which meets the accuracy requirements for rapid forestry surveying.},

This is exemplified in the field of forest management, where the extraction of individual tree crown information stands to benefit operational budgets. We explored training a region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) to automatically delineate individual tree crown (ITC) polygons in regenerating forests (14 years after harvest) using true colour red-green-blue (RGB) imagery with an average ground sampling distance (GSD) of 3 cm. We predicted ITC polygons to extract height information using canopy height models generated from digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) point clouds. Our approach yielded an average precision of 0.98, an average recall of 0.85, and an average F1 score of 0.91 for the delineation of ITC. Remote height measurements were strongly correlated with field height measurements (r2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.34 m). The mean difference between DAP-derived and field-collected height measurements was -0.37 m and -0.24 m for white spruce (Picea glauca) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), respectively. Our results show that accurate ITC delineation in young, regenerating stands is possible with fine-spatial resolution RGB imagery and that predicted ITC can be used in combination with DAP to estimate tree height.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAVLS) systems present a relatively new means of remote sensing and are increasingly applied in the field of forest ecology and management. However, one of the most essential parameters in forest inventory, tree diameter at breast height (DBH), cannot be directly extracted from aerial point cloud data due to the limitations of scanning angle and canopy obstruction. Therefore, in this study DBH-UAVLS point cloud estimation models were established using a generalized nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model. The experiments were conducted using Larix olgensis as the subject species, and a total of 8364 correctly delineated trees from UAVLS data within 118 plots across 11 sites were used for DBH modeling. Both tree- and plot-level metrics were obtained using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and were used as the models' independent predictors. The results indicated that the addition of site-level random effects significantly improved the model fitting. Compared with nonparametric modeling approaches (random forest and k-nearest neighbors) and uni- or multivariable weighted nonlinear least square regression through leave-one-site-out cross-validation, the NLME model with local calibration achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values (1.94 cm) and the most stable prediction across different sites. Using the site in a random-effects model improved the transferability of LiDAR-based DBH estimation. The best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP), used to conduct local model calibration, led to an improvement in the models' performance as the number of field measurements increased. The research provides a baseline for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) small-scale forest inventories and might be a reasonable alternative for operational forestry.},

  abstract = {The paper highlights recent results of forest structure analysis at single tree level based on analyzing airborne full waveform LiDAR data. Single trees are automatically detected by a 3D segmentation technique applied directly to laser point clouds, which uses the normalized cut segmentation combined with a stem detection method. A subsequent classification identifies tree species using salient features that are defined on single 3D tree segments and utilize the additional information extracted from the reflected laser signal by the waveform decomposition. The stem volume and diameter at breast height (DBH) are estimated by a multiple linear regression analysis which uses tree shape parameters derived from the 3D model of the trees. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with full waveform LiDAR data. The data were captured with the Riegl LMS Q-560 system at a point density of 25points/m2 under leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. The analysis of waveform data in the tree structure shows that the intensity and pulse width discriminate stem points, crown points and ground points significantly. The unsupervised classification of deciduous and coniferous trees is in the best case 93\%. If a supervised classification is applied the accuracy is slightly increased to 95\%. Concerning stem volume estimation, in the case of coniferous trees the study shows a low RMSE of about 0.46m3 to 0.43m3 both for the watershed segmentation and the new normalized cut segmentation. In the case of deciduous trees RMSE has increased by 14\% in leaf off condition and by 4\% in leaf on condition for the normalized cut segmentation. A similar trend can be confirmed for DBH estimation as well, even demonstrating a larger benefit from 3D segmentation. The study results proved that the 3D segmentation approach is not only capable of detecting more small trees in the lower forest layer but also can allow to derive more promising features of single trees used for yielding better performance in species classification and estimation of forest structural parameters, especially for deciduous trees.},

  abstract = {Characterization of forest attributes at fine scales is necessary to manage terrestrial resources in a manner that replicates, as closely as possible, natural ecological conditions. In forested ecosystems, management decisions are driven by variables such as forest composition, forest structure (both vertical and horizontal), and other ancillary data (i.e., topography, soils, slope, aspect, and disturbance regime dynamics). Vertical forest structure is difficult to quantify and yet is an important component in the decision-making process. This study investigated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for classifying this attribute at landscape scales for inclusion into decision-support systems. Analysis of field-derived tree height variance demonstrated that this metric could distinguish between two classes of vertical forest structure. Analysis of LiDAR-derived tree height variance demonstrated that differences between single-story and multistory vertical structural classes could be detected. Landscape-scale classification of the two structure classes was 97\% accurate. This study suggested that within forest types of the Intermountain West region of the United States, LiDAR-derived tree heights could be useful in the detection of differences in the continuous, nonthematic nature of vertical forest structure with acceptable accuracies. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.
